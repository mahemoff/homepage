<H2>What's a usability lab?</H2>

Here's a textbook-ish definition:

<P><code>A Usability Lab (Laboratory) is an environment where users are studied
interacting with a system for the sake of evaluating the system's
usability.</code>

<H2>What does a usability lab look like? Who's involved?</H2>

Basically, there is a user being observed interacting with the "target system".

<P>A typical setup would be:

  <UL>

    <LI><span class="listTitle">User</span> A sample user sitting in front of a
    PC which is running the target software.

    <LI><span class="listTitle">Facilitator</span> A usability specialist
    sitting alongside the Test Subject. The Facilitator usually gives the User
    tasks to complete, while providing some help and coffee.

    <LI><span class="listTitle">Observer</span> Behind a one-way mirror, an
    observer watches the user interact with the system.

    <LI><span class="listTitle">Technician</span> A technician ensures the
    target system is running smoothly, as well as any recording equipment.

  </UL>

  <P>It wouldn't be any fun if it was all the same. There are many variations
    on the theme above. For example, a small lab might combine the roles of
    facilitator, observer, and technician (picture, if you will, the the same
    guy returning to the room wearing a Groucho Marx mask). Similarly, there
    might be more than one of each role --- for example, several users would be
    a good choice if you were testing a multiplayer video game.

<H2>What's with the one-way mirror?</H2>

As the wizard urged Dorothy, <A
href="http://home.cfl.rr.com/mmeara/page4m.htm">"Pay No Attention to the Man
Behind the Curtain!"</A>. The presence of the observers and recording equipment
can intimidate users, or at least make them behave differently. Furthermore,
the equipment may be noisy, as can be observers if there are several of them.

<H2>Does the user know what's going on behind the mirror?</H2>

Professional ethics standards dictate that experimenters give users honest
information about who will be observing, what will be recorded, and how it will
be used.

<H2>Is the user being evaluated?</H2>

The purpose of a usability lab is to test the software, not the user. The
underlying assumption is that the user is representative of the user base. This
should be established by the subject recruitment process and any screening
activities. If the user encounters difficulties during the test, the most
likely conclusion is poor usability for the target user base, rather than an
underperforming user.

<H2>Why is a usability lab so expensive to hire?</H2>

<P>That's the price you pay for a polished product. A typical usability lab is
run by qualified staff, has sophisticated equipment to maintain, and occupies a
reasonable amount of space. That's quite a lot for a facility in a niche
industry.

<H2>I can't afford to hire a usability lab</H2>

<P>Here is some advice:

  <UL>

    <LI>First and foremost, have you or your boss <A
    href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0120958104/102-2070290-0648135?v=glance">cost-justified
    the usability work</A>? Remember, poor usability has devastated many
    would-be killer apps.

    <LI>Being a relatively new, niche, industry, you will find usability labs
      vary widely in their offerings. Shop around.

    <LI>Even a single usability lab will often be quite flexible regarding
      pricing. You might be able to drop the price if you can give them a
      benefit. For example, perhaps they will tie a package in with consulting
      costs. If you're dealing with a research institution, you might be able
      to offer them a juicy case study.

    <LI>Even if you can't test in a usability lab, you can still get some great
      data by testing in your own environment. Experience indicates you'll be
      amazed (read: "shocked", "horrified") by the things you see when you put
      real-life users in front of your product. Much better during testing than
      after rollout.

  </UL>
