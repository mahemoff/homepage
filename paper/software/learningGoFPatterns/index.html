    <span class="summary" style="font-weight: bold;">The <A
    Href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201633612?v=glance">GoF
    Design Patterns Catalog</A> is optimised for reference usage, not for
    learning. Instead of reading cover-to-cover, there are certain properties
    you can exploit for to learn design patterns more rapidly. The tips here
    show you how to do just that.</span>

  <H2>Tip: Learn Patterns In The Following Order</H2>

      <P class="sideNote">The GoF text doesn't order patterns in a manner
        suited for easy learning, e.g. from easiest to hardest.</P>

    <P>Here's the most important tip. The original text groups patterns in
    three categories, and then alphabetically within each. All good for
    reference purposes, but lousy for learning. For example, the first pattern
    is <span class="pattern">Abstract&nbsp;Factory</span>, one of the more
    sophisticated entries. A much simpler starting point, <span
    class="pattern">Facade</span>, is buried in the middle. The alphabetical
    order is unnecessary, and even the categories are not especially
    meaningful, for learning purposes. 

    So it's clear you need to learn the patterns in a different order. The
    problem is you don't know them yet, so how can a pattern newcomer decide
    on an order? The answer is to use an existing "learner's roadmap" - that's
    why I'm listing a suitable order below. Hopefully, any future revision of
    the book will do likewise.

    The order I recommend is based on three principles:
    <UL>
      <LI> Group similar patterns, as the commonalities will reduce the overall
      effort. You're effectively learning 16 or so patterns with some
      variations, rather than 23 individual patterns.
      <LI> Early on, focus on the  simpler patterns.
      <LI> Early on, focus on the patterns you have probably
           already encountered.
    </UL>

    With that in mind, here is the order I recommend. As in the book, page
    numbers are shown in parentheses.

    <P>... <span class="patternGroup"> Easy GoF Patterns.</span> These easy
    patterns concern only one class, or a straightforward relationship among
    several classes. Incidentally, don't discount them as being ingenious;
    their ease of learning actually stands testimony to their cleverness. Learn
    in the following order ...

    <OL>

        <LI><span class="listTitle">Facade (185)</span> All the ingredients for
        a starting pattern.  Conceptually clear, solves a problem many
        developers have experienced, many real-world metaphors. Good
        introduction to the world of patterns.</LI>

        <LI><span class="listTitle">Singleton (127)</span> Also very easy to
        follow.</LI>

        <LI><span class="listTitle">Mediator (273)</span> A "Man in the
        Middle". Again, typical problem with a straightforward solution.</LI>

        <LI><span class="listTitle">Iterator (257)</span> Conceptually simple
        problem and solution, Should be a breeze for anyone who has looped
	across a collection using the standard Java 1.0-1.4 iteration
	mechanism.</LI>

        <LI><span class="listTitle">Strategy (315)</span> The first pattern
        here to be centered around polymorphism, making it a bit more
        sophisticated. But it's still quite simple as it concerns a single
        class hierarchy.</LI>

        <LI><span class="listTitle">Command (233)</span> SIMILARITY:
        <span class="pattern">Command</span> is almost identical to <span
        class="pattern">Strategy</span>.  That is, you call an "execute" method
        and the instance executes itself. The only difference here is Command "feels"
        more dynamic - it is, at some level, triggered by an external agent
        (e.g. an end-user).  In contrast, a <span
        class="pattern">Strategy</span> often represents a business rule, e.g.
        tax calculation. So the application may vary, but what actually happens
        is identical.</LI>

        <LI><span class="listTitle">Builder (97)</span> SIMILARITY: This is
        really just a special case of <span class="pattern">Strategy</span>,
        applied specifically to the problem of creating an object. The name is
        misleading, because the most important logic is actually in the <span
        class="pattern">Director</span>. The Director has a fixed high-level
        procedure, but the actual construction depends on what its building,
        and that construction process is encapsulated in a <span
        class="pattern">Strategy</span> object called the <span
        class="pattern">Builder</span>.</LI>

	<LI><span class="listTitle">State (305)</span> SIMILARITY: This pattern
	is quite similar to <span class="pattern">Strategy</span> and <span
	class="pattern">Command</span> - keep these patterns in mind.  It is
	based on polymorphism, and once again is centered around a single
	superclass/interface with any number of subclasses.  Unlike those
	patterns, it is not intended to perform a single action.  Instead, is
	says how any number of actions are performed while in a certain state.
	Don't complicate things by worrying about state transitions; that's
	actually not the main point of <span class="pattern">State</span>. Once
	you understand that <span class="pattern">State</span> is about what
	happens in state X, the concept of state transitions follows
	naturally.</LI>

        <LI><span class="listTitle">Template Method (325)</span> Another
        pattern involving polymorphism.  Still only a single class hierarchy.
        Also important to see how this is an alternative to
        <span class="pattern">Strategy</span>.</LI>

        <LI><span class="listTitle">Factory Method (107)</span> SIMILARITY:
        This pattern is just a specal case of <span class="pattern">Template
        Method</span>. As stated in the text, it applies only to <span
        class="pattern">Template Methods</span> which involve the creation of
        an object. <span class="em">Note that most people nowadays use a
        different definition: a public creation method, typically of the class
        (or subclass) that the method belongs to.</span></LI>

        <LI><span class="listTitle">Memento (283)</span> With its involvement
        in <span class="techTerm">Undo</span> functionality, this pattern is
        related to <span class="techTerm">Command</span>. It's easy to
	understand once you see that certain commands cause loss of
	information. That is, you can't reverse the effect of a command just by
	knowing the final state. For instance, the command "multiply by zero"
	will always lead to zero, so how can you reverse it to get the original
	number? The answer is to attach the original number to the command. The attached number is a <span class="pattern">memento</span.</LI>

        <LI><span class="listTitle">Prototype (117)</span> Actually very
        simple, but is listed last here because it is not used very much in
        practice.  Actually, the structure diagram shows a class hierarchy, but
        the pattern is essentially about a single class being cloned.</LI>

      <P><span class="patternGroup"> ... Intermediate GoF Patterns.</span> Now
      that you've been exposed to the basic patterns, you are well equipped to
      read up on pattern theory in general. Then, when you're ready to proceed
      ...

     <P><LI><span class="listTitle">Proxy (207)</span> Should be familiar to
     anyone who has used a web proxy. </LI>

       <LI><span class="listTitle">Decorator (175)</span> SIMILARITY:
       <span class="pattern">Proxy</span> is a special case of <span
       class="pattern">Decorator</span>. It's worth learning <span
       class="pattern">Proxy</span> first, because it's a more familiar
       situation.  Once understood, it's not so hard to see how a <span
       class="pattern">Decorator</span> could wrap classes to perform tasks
       other than those performed by <span class="pattern">Proxy</span>. <span
       class="pattern">Proxy</span> is usually used with regard to security and
       networking, and typically a class with a proxy cannot be accessed
       directly. In contrast, a <span class="pattern">Decorator</span> is
       usually used to enhance an existing class's functionality. A client can
       freely choose whether to wrap a class with its <span
       class="pattern">Decorator(s)</span>.  As with the <span
       class="pattern">Strategy-Command</span> relationship, <span
       class="pattern">Decorator</span> shares the same mechanism as <span
       class="pattern">Proxy</span>, varying only in the application area and
       style of use.</LI>

       <LI><span class="listTitle">Adapter (139)</span> Learn along with
       <span class="pattern">Bridge</span> (below).</LI>

       <LI><span class="listTitle">Bridge (151)</span> SIMILARITY: Similar to
       Adaptor, but with subtle differences, to Adapter. Good to learn these in
       tandem and most importantly, to understand the emphasis here is on
       up-front design, whereas Adapter is usually used to avoid changing
       existing classes. So a Bridge is usually designed when neither end is in place. But both ends (sometimes just one end) of an Adapter already exist
       before the Adapter is written to glue them together. Many Java
       frameworks are an example of Bridge, where a set of interfaces are
       listed and indivudual vendors can then provide their own
       implementations.</LI>

       <LI><span class="listTitle">Observer (293)</span> Makes some
       sophisticated use of object-oriented constructs, but not especially
       difficult as there are some great real-world metapors, viz., publishing
       and broadcasting. Also, should be intimately familiar for anyone who has
       written GUI applications or subscription protocols like RSS.</LI>

    <P><span class="patternGroup">... Advanced GoF Patterns.</span> Don't worry
      - they're all very accessible.  A design pattern is supposed to be a
        distinct, simple, idea, and the GoF patterns have certainly adhered to
        this principle ...  <P>

      <LI><span class="listTitle">Composite (163)</span> A recursive, tree-like
      data structure, formulated in OO terms.</LI>

      <LI><span class="listTitle">Interpreter (243)</span> SIMILARITY:
      <span class="pattern">Interpreter</span> may seem a bit unfamiliar as
      you've probably not written a parser before, but it's actually just a
      special case of <span class="pattern">Composite</span> applied to
      parsing.  Note that this pattern is the odd one out in the overall GoF
      collection, because it is domain-specific - its applicability is limited
      to parsing.</LI>

      <LI><span class="listTitle">Chain Of Responsibility (223)</span> Best
      learned with regard to a <span class="pattern">Composite</span>
      structure. Confronted with a request, children try to handle it, and if
      they can't, they  pass it to their parents, and so on, until eventually
      some class along the chain can deal with it.</LI>

      <LI><span class="listTitle">Abstract Factory (87)</span> Often
      misinterpreted as being just a Factory, but actually it's more than that
      because it allows for creation of class families.</LI>

      <LI><span class="listTitle">Flyweight (195)</span> Think of a pool of
      expensive objects which are shared, such as EJBs or database connections.
      This pattern may not be familiar to everyone, hence this pattern is
      considered a bit more difficult.</LI>

      <LI><span class="listTitle">Visitor (331)</span> Alphabetical order lined
      up with complexity in this case, because this pattern does deserve it's
      place at the end of the GoF text! It helps to see <span
      class="pattern">Visitor</span> as an after-the-fact substitute for
      multiple inheritance.</LI>

  <H2>Tip: It's the Patterns, Stupid!</H2>

    The pattern format is simple enough to require no introduction. Read the
    introductory material, and any other info on pattern theory, only when you
    are confident with some of the patterns themselves.

  <H2>Tip: Only Read High-Level Pattern Details</H2>

    The great thing about patterns is their consistent, well-organised, format.
    Use this format to concentrate on high-level information and filter out the
    detail such as code segments.  On first reading, <span class="keyText">you
    only need to familiarise yourself with the "Intent", then glance at the
    "Structure" diagram, and finally read just the "Motivation"</span>. Only
    read other sections if you don't understand anything here.

  <H2>Tip: Think of Real-World Metaphors</H2>

    I'm not talking about how you've used the patterns in existing software.
    I'm talking about patterns of social structures, building architecture, and
    so on, which are similar to the design patterns. For example, the <span
    class="pattern">Facade</span> pattern is illustrated by an office
    receptionist, and the <span class="pattern">Proxy</span> pattern is
    illustrated by a CEO's personal assistant.  <P><span
    class="internalNote"><span class="internalNoteTitle">Update:</span> I have
    created <A href="/paper/software/gofMetaphors/">metaphor examples for all
    GoF patterns here</A>.</span>

  <H2>Tip: Therefore, BOOM!</H2>

    Here is a tip for authors of patterns which will also help you in learning
    them. A pattern should read as <a
    href="http://www.rolemodelsoftware.com/moreAboutUs/publications/thereforeBoom.php">"Therefore,
    BOOM!"</A>. A clear problem that frustrates you, makes you think "how can I
    ever deal with this", and then BOOM! You slap yourself in the realisation
    that such a simple solution exists. The GoF patterns are cunning in their
    simplicity - if you understand the pattern, you should be able to state the
    problem in one sentence and the solution in another.

  <H2>Background</H2>

    <P>The  <A
    Href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201633612?v=glance">GoF
    Patterns</A> are now required learning for most developers. GoF (Gang of
    Four/Gamma et al.) Patterns are now part of software folklore, used daily
    in real-world development and mandatory education for students and
    practioners seeking certification, as in the <A
    Href="http://training.sun.com/US/catalog/courses/CX-310-051.html">Sun
    Certified Enterprise Architect (SCEA)</A> exam. The tips on this page help
    you get a heads-up as quick as possible. They are based on my experiences
    in using the patterns, mentoring other developers, and lecturing at
    university.

    <P>The most important thing to understand is the original text is written
    primarily to support the task of real-world development, rather than a text
    for pattern newcomers. It is a reference text, and you need to approach it
    differently if you are learning the patterns. For instance, the patterns
    within each section are ordered alphabetical - clearly, that's not the
    fastest order to learn them in.

    <P>By following these tips, you can reduce a 400 page book down to about 50
    pages of the most useful information, and cover these pages in a more
    natural order. So learning GoF patterns won't seem quite as much work. Once
    that's done, you can go back and pick up some of the detail.
