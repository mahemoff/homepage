<H1>SHOW ME THE GUI! Patterns To Help You Deal with Users Who Are Forever <I>Too Busy
Right Now</I></H1>

<P>Conventional usability wisdom says we should all spend lots of time studying
users. Great, but what about users are perenially "too busy right now"?  I'm
focusing mostly on ethnographic observations and evaluating (paper) prototypes,
because that is really all you can hope to do.  Participatory design with the
end-users is right out.

<P>Most of the patterns are based on visiting external sites, hence issues
regarding what to do while waiting for access to users.

<H2>The Problem</H2>

Access to users can be difficult due to a combination of several factors:

  <UL>
    <LI><span class="listTitle">Users are rare and/or highly paid:</span> A
    trading system I worked on recently only had 10 primary users
    worldwide. It was fun working on a system where I got to meet the entire
    global user population, but needless to say, their time was considered a
    precious commodity.

    <LI> <span class="listTitle">Heavy workload:</span> Users often simply have
    too much work to do, and can't spare the time. Raving about
    future gains will have little effect if the culture doesn't value
    anything beyond next Tuesday.

    <LI> <span class="listTitle">Immediate response required:</span> 
    Some users, even if their average workload is low, must respond immediately
    to events which could occur at any time, such as calls from clients. For
    instance, I once observed the night shift in an intensive care unit. It was
    quiet enough to talk to the medical specialists, but they were never fully
    attendant because they were constantly checking on their patients and
    responding to reports from nurses. If you're only visiting for a short
    time, you might find lady luck reduces your interaction with users to a few
    short minutes.

    <LI><span class="listTitle">Long hours:</span> Users who work long hours
    find it difficult to stay back for a usability study. Even if they do, the
    impact of fatigue means you are likely to get a biased result.

    <LI><span class="listTitle">Status Management:</span> In some environments,
    workers avoid taking time out from their core work for fear of retribution
    from co-workers, who may perceive it as a soft option. This is exacerbated
    in those situations where a manager will sacrifice only the inexperienced
    and untalented.

    <LI><span class="listTitle">Low Perceived Value:</span> Some organisations
    have short-term agendas and don't wish to devote resources to longer-term
    benefits. Moreover, many simply don't know much about user-centered
    techniques, and can't see the benefits of studies with users.

<H2>The Patterns</H2>

    Presented in summary &quot;Pattlet&quot; format.

  <H3>Distraction-Free Zone</H3>

  <P> <span class="patSolSum">Encourage users away from their work area.</span>
    This way, you'll get their full attention. Furthermore, what seemed urgent
    a couple of minutes ago is no longer quite as important. They are acutely
    aware of this phenomenon and often suggest it themselves.

      <P> Of course, a usability study must involve users in their natural
      environment, so do that too. But with busy users, the compromise of going
      elsewhere is often worthwhile.

  <H3>Surrogate Users</H3>

  <P> <span class="patSolSum">Work with &quot;Surrogate Users&quot; - people who are similar enough to
    your target users to provide useful infomation</span>. Candidates would include:
    (a) people who previously worked as the target users (e.g. ex-traders who
    have moved into IT or management can be "surrogate traders"); (b) people
    who have worked in the same environment, but in a different role (e.g.
    retail staff at a pharmacy can be "surrogate pharmacists").

  <H3>Userless Evaluations</H3>

  <P> <span class="patSolSum">Use expert knowledge to compensate for user
      feedback.</span> We all know the importance of testing with real
      users, but engineering work is a trade-off. If testing with real users is
      more difficult than usual, then, all other things being equal, effort
      will be better spent not evauating with users. This is about being
      pragmatic, rather than abandoning the cause of user testing: you can and
      should still test, but make it a smaller proportion of the overall
      effort.  Userless evaluations would include heuristic-driven inspections
      and cognitive walkthroughs.

  <H3>Feature-Driven Microevaluations</H3>

  <P> <span class="patSolSum">Evaluate features, not entire systems.</span>

  <H3>Intermittent Dialogue</H3>

  <P>If you can't catch users in person, <span class="patSolSum">use other
    forms of communication</span>Phone calls, email, instant messaging, online
    prototypes, faxes or photos of drawings, screenshots.

  <H3>Passive Observation</H3>

      <P> Don't get users off-side by pestering them. Few people like to be
      shadowed all day long - even if it's passive observation. It can get
      annoying, and it can also make confidential activities awkward.  So while
      onsite, <span class="patSolSum">be prepared to spend a lot of time away
      from users</span>.

  <H3>Perfect Preparation</H3>

    Every minute is vital, so <span class="patSolSum">prepare ahead to get it
    right</span>. To uncover any flaws in the logic undermining planned
    activities, rehearse them all with a couple of Surrogate Users beforehand.
    And ensure you have the right material.

  <H3>Sideline Activity</H3>

    <span class="patSolSum">Have something else to do while waiting for access.
    When on-site, you won't always be with the user, since they might not have
    the time and you should give them a break anyway (see <span
      class="patSolSum">Back Out</span>). Later in the visit, you might be able
    to use this time to analyse results and plan further work. But earlier on,
    you will probably be unproductive if you're trying to analyse any results.
    So <span class="patSolSum">Bring along extra work to occupy yourself while
      waiting</A>.

  <H3>Standby Zone</H3>

    What do you while waiting? Visit Starbucks? That could get tedious if you're
    waiting for hours on end. Be sure to <span class="patSolSum">Organise an
    area to spend time while waiting for the user</span>. Ideally, you'll
    want a desk with an connection to the LAN and/or internet. Best to
    organise it in advance of the visit.
