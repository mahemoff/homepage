<H1>Software As She's Developed - Mahemoff's Software Theory for the Here and Now</H1>

  Here are some of my learning tips and views on software development -
  patterns, design, and so on.  The name, "Software As She's Developed", is a
  tribute to <a href="http://collinslibrary.com/english.html">the most
  incompetent phrasebook ever</A>, a reminder that software is still an
  immature discipline grasping for reason. We have a long way to go.

        <A Href="/paper/software/learningGoFPatterns/">GoF Patterns: Rapid
        Learning</A> The GoF patterns (AKA Gang Of Four, Gamma et al.) makes a
        great reference, but the text isn't organised optimally for pattern
        newcomers.

        <LI><A Href="/paper/software/gofMetaphors/">GoF Patterns: Real World
        Metaphors</A> The GoF patterns aren't just about software. For people
        learning them, it's useful to see how the patterns apply to real-world
        concepts like social relationships and business activities?
