<b>Abstract</b>
<P>
When developers produce software for users from different cultures, they
should consider how both overt and covert cultural factors impact on the
requirements.  Overt factors (e.g.  measurement units, calendars) are
well-defined and easily understood.  Covert factors (e.g.  mental
disposition, perception) are more vague and may not be immediately obvious.
Both types of factors demand early attention to produce usable software.
Usability tests and local consultants can help to identify requirements for
internationalisation, but should be supplemented with recorded information
about cultural factors. We provide a classification of factors which impact
on requirements, and propose that it could form the basis for a repository
of cultural information accessible by developers.
<P>
<b>Introduction</b>
<P>
    Increasing connectivity, the move towards a global economy, and growing
    use of technology are making internationalisation an increasingly
    important concern for developers. Software intended for international
    audiences must exhibit functional and non-functional features which are
    appropriate to the end-users' culture and conventions.
<P>
    There are many advantages in developing systems which can be used by a
    wide range of people. The most obvious benefit for users is
    software which closely matches their needs. Furthermore, there are
    synergies to be gained by using the same systems as others, especially
    as nations draw closer together. Poorer countries would also benefit
    from technology which helped developers to produce systems for less
    substantial markets. The benefits to organisations are obvious: an
    opportunity to boost international market share, and simultaneously
    reduce risk by diversifying their served market.
<P>
    Typically, the implementation of such software involves two key stages
    (Luong et al.,&nbsp;1995). The first
    stage--internationalisation (also called
    ``localisation-enabling'')--prepares the core system to enable the
    subsequent localisation process. Localisation is the process of
    ``plugging in'' the locale-specific data into the internationalised
    structure.  Clearly, a fundamental component of the
    internationalisation process is distinguishing between the needs which
    are common to all users, and those which are culture-specific.
    Development effort is optimised when only features depending on the
    perceived needs of end-users are customised; the rest of the system
    will then be common for all versions.
<P>
    However, it is a non-trivial problem to separate requirements
    which are culture-specific from those which apply to all versions.
    Some information can be obtained via extensive prototyping and
    beta-testing. In reality, though, errors revealed in the testing stage
    are often too difficult or too costly to fix (Lim and Long,
    1994), and the identification of defects does not
    guarantee that they can be removed (Karat and Dayton,
    1995). This paper shows how cultural factors can be
    separated into distinct categories. Our classification is intended to
    help developers identify culture-specific requirements and understand
    how they can be addressed. At present, there is insufficient
    information available to practitioners who wish to define requirements
    for international audiences. We propose that the level of support could
    be improved by establishing a central repository of culture-specific
    information, based on our classification. Thus, we begin by discussing
    how cultures vary and describing the cultural factors which can impact
    on requirements. We then discuss implications for the requirements
    process, and the benefits which a repository would offer.
<P>
<b>Cultural Differences which Affect Software Design</b>
<P>
    The term <i>culture</i> is used throughout this paper. A person's
    culture can extend beyond their ethnicity to include factors such as
    their hobbies and lifestyle.  People therefore belong to more than one
    culture. The term <i>locale</i> generally refers to the realisation
    of the cultural variable in software, such as ``Japanese'', or
    ``French-Canadian''; Uren et al. (1993) define it as
    ``a combination of language, region, and code or character set''. Since
    culture goes beyond geographic details, it follows that locales can do
    likewise.
<P>
    Understanding the user is a fundamental component of requirements
    analysis. If the user's cultural background is not taken into account,
    usability problems will arise, and this suggests that we need to
    develop models of culture. A user's culture can be modelled in various
    ways (see Hoft,&nbsp;1996). For the purpose of requirements
    analysis, a useful approach is suggested by Yeo's (1995)
    dichotomy of overt and covert factors.
<P>
    Overt factors are tangible, obvious characteristics of a culture, such
    as calendars, units of measure, and character sets. In many ways, these
    variables are somewhat arbitrary. It is true that some of these factors
    embody traces of cultural history; the fact that Australia shares the
    same calendar and date format as England provides information about its
    background. However, overt factors <em>per se</em> tend not to offer deep
    cultural insights.  They are the daily conventions under which a
    society operates and must be supported in software; most people do not
    particularly care whether their currency is denoted by dollars or
    Francs, but once the decision has been made, financial packages must
    certainly cater for it.  Since overt factors are based on convention,
    they tend to correspond to national boundaries.
<P>
    At the other end of the spectrum are covert factors--vaguely-defined,
    complex aspects of a society which are easily misunderstood by
    outsiders and are sometimes so subtle that they may go unnoticed
    altogether. Verbal and non-verbal communication style, the meanings of
    symbols and problem-solving techniques are all examples of covert
    cultural factors.  Whereas overt factors reside on the ``tip of the
    iceberg'', covert factors are the unspoken and unconscious rules that
    hide below the surface(see Hoft,&nbsp;1996).  Similarly
    there are varying degrees of covertness. Some aspects, such as
    commonplace customs, are observed with relative ease; others--like
    psychological facets--require deep probing and careful
    experimentation, and will always be the subject of vigorous debate.
<P>
    This paper modifies Yeo's definitions to distinguish explicitly between
    cultural factors and consequential software features. Instead of
    treating an icon as a covert factor, it is viewed as a software feature
    whose interpretation will depend on certain covert factors.
<P>
    To document cultural factors in such a way as to directly support the
    work of developers, it is desirable to extend this two-factor
    classification. After surveying the literature for examples of cultural
    factors, we produced a more refined classification in which overt and
    covert factors are further divided into six and four sub-categories,
    respectively. These factors are presented in the next section.
<P>
<b>Implications for Requirements Engineers</b> <A NAME="secovert">&#160;</A>
<P>
    <b>Identification of Relevant Overt and Covert Factors</b>
<P>
    To understand the impact of overt and covert cultural factors on
    requirements, an initial step for practitioners is to be aware of the
    wide range of cultural aspects which these categories cover.
<P>
    <b>Overt factors</b> can be divided into six sub-categories:
        <OL><LI> Time factors, e.g. calendar, day turnover;<LI> Writing issues, e.g. character set, text direction, special
              characters;<LI> Language issues, e.g. word ordering, use of jargon;<LI> Measures, e.g. currency, units of length;<LI> Formatting, e.g. numbers, date and time, number rounding; and<LI> External systems, e.g. standard page size.
    </OL>
<P>
    Overt factors typically result in non-functional requirements.
    However, in situations where the user can customise software according
    to the factors, there will also be some functionality required. A
    functional requirement for a manufacturing system might state that the
    user can choose between metric and imperial units.
<P>
    <b>Covert factors</b> fall into four major categories: 
    <DL ><DT><STRONG>Mental disposition</STRONG>
<DD>
    Theories of human-computer interaction which are grounded in Western
    psychologies do not necessarily generalise to deal with other cultures.
    Evers and Day (1997) found Indonesian and Chinese
    users differed in their design preferences towards a hypothetical
    computer program.  The results indicated that the former group judged
    the software predominately on the basis of usability, while the latter
    group was persuaded more by usefulness.  Differences in mental
    disposition bring into question concepts of usability which are
    sometimes elevated to the status of ``laws'' or ``axioms''. Although
    many usability gurus advocate an <tt>Undo</tt> function to allow
    exploration, Ito and Nakakoji (1996) claim that Japanese
    people regard trial-and-error as ``tedious and time-consuming''.  This
    does not eliminate the need for reversible functionality in Japanese
    software, but it does suggest a lower priority and the facility might
    therefore be abandoned if substantial development effort is required.
<P>
    <DT><STRONG>Perception</STRONG>
<DD>
    Variation in life experience means that the same stimulus can lead to
    vastly different interpretations.  Therefore, metaphors can be
    culturally dependent. The standard folder icon, for instance, is
    inappropriate for countries where documents are traditionally stored in
    cardboard boxes (Marcus,&nbsp;1996).  Sometimes perception
    problems arise from differences in interpretation, rather than flawed
    identification.  For instance, Russo and Boor (1993)
    comment that red represents danger in America but happiness in China.
    Chinese users of American software are just as likely as American users
    to correctly identify the colour of a red icon. However, the icon might
    convey a very different mood.
<P>
   <DT><STRONG>Social interaction rules</STRONG>
<DD>
    Body language, facial expression, and dialogue style all vary with
    culture. Obviously, developers of multi-user systems must consider the
    rules of human-human interaction. However, single-user systems also
    depend on an understanding of everyday social interaction.  According
    to Belge (1995), ``it is impolite to `beep' in Japan, since
    this calls attention to a possible error on the part of the user''.
    Non-verbal communication also varies; one study identified eighteen
    cultural dimensions of hand posture which are relevant to virtual
    environments (Edwards,&nbsp;1995). These dimensions would
    need to be considered for both input (e.g. data gloves) and output
    (e.g. an animated agent or icon representing a hand). Because
    human-computer interaction is often viewed as a dialogue between two
    agents, social rules familiar to the human agent should be obeyed by
    the computer agent.
<P>
    <DT><STRONG>Context of use</STRONG>
<DD>
    The environment in which a user operates can vary markedly, and therefore
    impose a range of constraints.  Automatic Teller Machines in Sweden,
    for example, are built with large buttons to help people wearing thick
    gloves (Nielson,&nbsp;1996).  Similarly, building
    architectures and organisational hierarchies will affect requirements
    for facilities such as reporting and access rights.  While Americans
    typically work in their own area, Japanese offices are more open
    (Fernandes, 1995).  Workers in open offices
    probably have less need for e-mail, but are more liable to embarrassment
    from beeps after errors.
<P>
 </DL>
<P>
    Covert factors come in many guises.  As with overt factors, they can
    translate into non-functional requirements.  However, some also
    necessitate changes in the functionality itself.  As a whole, covert
    factors are likely to cause major problems for developers if they are
    not identified sufficiently early.
<P>
    <b>How Cultural Factors Impact on Requirements</b>
<P>
    The most obvious implication in this area is that requirements
    engineers should seek detailed information about the anticipated user
    base. The variance among cultures shows that it is not enough to
    classify users simply by their system-oriented role (e.g.
    administrator, data entry clerk). The internationalisation process
    suggests an understanding of variables across target markets, so that
    the appropriate hooks can be applied.  Thus, when requirements
    engineers examine user characteristics, it is essential that they
    forecast user bases for later versions of the system. The
    internationalisation-enabling phase can then isolate the appropriate
    culture-specific variables. Even though these variables might be
    identical for initial releases, later versions could vary them when
    users are introduced who require different features. The localisation
    process is relatively straightforward, and might only involve updating
    a database or adding an image. In contrast, if unanticipated cultural
    variables are introduced, a far more expensive process of re-enabling
    may need to be carried out.
<P>
    Developing culturally-aware requirements specifications means more than
    just declaring who will use the system. As with other user
    characteristics, this information must be reflected throughout the
    requirements. There are some important differences between overt and
    covert factors in the way they affect requirements. Overt factors
    generally map isomorphically into non-functional requirements. For
    example, the knowledge that users require measurements in metric or
    imperial format simply means that the software must support both of
    these formats. The only other issue is how users can change their preferred measurement method. However, this becomes more of an issue
    about customisation than internationalisation itself.
<P>
    The situation is radically different for covert factors. Obviously,
    these factors can affect surface-level features of the user-interface,
    such as images, colour schemes, and auditory cues.  However, more
    profound effects also exist. Nielson (1990) reported
    on a French educational product which enables users to annotate poems.
    In some countries, it would be appropriate to allow children as well as
    the teacher to comment, but in France, only the teacher was allowed to
    add comments.  This relates to cultural issues of authority and
    independent thought.  A requirements engineer must therefore be aware
    of such issues to determine an important functional requirement.
<P>
    Likewise, covert factors can affect non-functional requirements.
    Consider how one type of non-functional
    requirement--performance--depends on who will be using the system.
    First, a notion of suitable performance depends on how users achieve
    their task, i.e. their mental disposition. Some people might prefer to
    spend most of their time planning potential actions without directly
    interacting with the system. For such users, performance requirements
    might be less overall, but higher in the worst case due to brief
    periods of high activity. Second, a notion of acceptable time to
    perform a task depends on how cultures perceive time and how long they
    are willing to wait. Third, the context of usage must also be
    considered.  An employer will be more tolerant of slow software if data
    entry clerks are being paid salaries which are small compared with the
    cost of development, or if the typical work processes in that locale do
    not place severe demands on performance.
<P>
    <b>Towards ``Culturally-Aware'' Requirements Specifications</b>
<P>
    Awareness of cultural variation is necessary, but not sufficient.  It
    is one thing to understand how various factors influence requirements,
    but it is a far more difficult task to produce a specification which
    accounts for these factors. The intangible nature of covert factors
    suggests that an insufficient treatment can lead to software which is
    unusable, inefficient, or offensive to individuals belonging to other
    cultures. Local expertise, prototypes and tests, and practical
    documentation can all help developers to support internationalisation
    issues adequately.
<P>
    Recruiting local expertise is one step in the right direction. At the
    very least, a local consultant or employee is likely to catch the most
    obvious mistakes. There have been many examples of poor branding and
    product design (see Taylor,&nbsp;1992)--some to the point
    of embarrassment--which could have been avoided with a few minutes of
    enquiry. At the same time, it must be recognised that even local
    consultants may fail to notice more subtle issues, especially if they
    are not usability or domain specialists. Organisations must make the
    appropriate trade-offs between the benefits of catering for specific
    markets, and the complexity and cost inherent in obtaining
    culture-specific knowledge.
<P>
    Prototyping is another option for determining requirements, and 
    the costs of overseas testing are diminishing as international networks
    improve. A more serious concern is the <em>validity</em> of usability tests.
    Herman (1996) found that subjects from the Far East
    positively evaluated a product which clearly led to poor performance,
    and noted that it was culturally unacceptable for the subjects to
    criticise too openly or directly. Special care must be taken when
    testing usability in different cultures. For example, Herman
    suggested that objective tests be conducted to augment subjective
    evaluations. Local experts can assist in devising tests to ensure
    that they are designed with the target culture in mind.
<P>
    While it is helpful to use consultants to gain knowledge about cultural
    factors, the information could be disseminated more widely, since not
    all organisations have the necessary resources to employ suitable
    consultants in a variety of locations. Fortunately, a large amount of
    this information is relevant to all developers, as these factors
    pertain to entire cultures rather than specific users. This makes it
    feasible to provide documentation to support developers'
    internationalisation work. To this end, we propose the establishment of
    an internet-based repository where internationalisation information can
    be made available. This archive could document the ways in which
    cultures vary and the consequent implications for software development.
    It would be open for contributions from developers and users. The
    classification of cultural variables discussed in this paper would
    serve as a basis for the organisation of the archive.
<P>
    To date, little work has been done in documenting this kind of
    information. Most internationalisation texts focus on implementation
    issues rather than higher-level concepts such as usability.  Since
    overt factors can be summarised relatively easily, it would be feasible
    to build an exhaustive list for each locale of the appropriate way to
    format a telephone number, the language(s) spoken, and so on. Such a
    reference would be extremely useful to developers, ensure that they do
    not have to ``re-invent the wheel'' in order to provide locale-specific
    features. Covert factors, although unlikely to be completely described,
    can still be documented to provide useful data for requirements
    engineers. There is certainly information which can be provided for
    many cultures, e.g. recognisable symbols and their meanings,
    significance of colours, particular usage contexts. Even if there is
    limited information about some factor, its mere presence in the
    repository might provoke requirements engineers to investigate its
    relevance.
<P>
    In situations where developers cannot justify recruiting local
    expertise or testing with users from other cultures, a repository would
    be an inexpensive way to gain information about other locales.
    However, it would work best in tandem with these other activities.
    Software organisations could use it to determine where it is
    appropriate to recruit local expertise. Prototype creators would
    interpret the repository's recommendations as appropriate for a
    particular project.  Tests could then be used to check if the
    interpretation was correct. For instance, if the repository says that
    the colour red is supposed to represent a warning for certain groups,
    there is still some uncertainty as to how this advice applies. Should a
    warning dialogue have a red background? Such issues can be resolved via
    user testing.  The repository still adds value by providing an initial
    direction; in this case, the designers at least know which colour
    applies for warnings.
<P>
<b>Conclusions</b>
<P>
    Establishing requirements for users of different cultures requires an
    understanding of the ways in which users vary. It is useful to
    distinguish between overt and covert factors. Overt factors, such as
    calendars and measurement units, are well-defined and
    easily-understood. Covert factors, such as mental processing and
    perception, require special consideration in requirements analysis
    because they are usually hidden or vague. Local expertise and
    prototyping are useful strategies for developers. In addition,
    supporting documentation should be provided, and this would supplement
    these other activities. We have proposed the construction of an
    international repository for this purpose.
<P>
    In this paper, we have discussed how cultural factors affect
    requirements. A further step would be to investigate how
    internationalisation fits into the overall development process. For
    example, should culture-specific requirements be gathered before,
    after, or at the same time as other requirements? In addition, we have
    proposed the establishment of an easily-accessed repository of cultural
    information.  While the classification introduced in this paper could
    act as the basis for such a repository, more research is needed to help
    us understand exactly how particular cultures vary along these
    dimensions.
