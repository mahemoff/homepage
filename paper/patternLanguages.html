<H1> Pattern Languages </H1>

  <P> This is the home for pattern languages I developed during my thesis.

  <P> You can access <A Href="/paper/fullplanet/frames/fullplanet.html">The Planet Pattern Language</A> here. 
  Planet supports development of internationalised systems. It guides on
  development process, high-level design, and detailed software design.

  Other languages to be added are:
  <UL>
    <LI> <B>Multiple Model-View-Controller (MVC)</B>: A Software Framework,
      consisting of a pattern language and software library, for developing
      scaleable interactive systems.</LI>
    <LI> <B>Safety-Usability Patterns:</B>Patterns to deal with usability in
      safety-critical systems.</LI>
  </UL>
