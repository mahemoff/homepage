                   <li class="itemize">It is often too expensive to produce for all audiences at the same time. Sometimes, a local

                   <li class="itemize">Introducing a new culture may not be a simple localisation procedure. The new culture may
                   necessitate  changes  to  the  core  product  and  this  can  be  painful.  As  one  example,  different
                   cultures use different rules for sorting words. An English-language implementation can sort
                   using  the  &#8220;<span

                   introduced? If the comparisons are scattered across the code, then a programmer will have the
                   unenviable task of replacing each one with a generic comparison function.

          attractiveness of foreign markets, consider size and value of customer demand, competitive importance of the
          market, and availability of expertise <span class="cite">[<a

          <!--l. 84--><p class="noindent">At this stage, establish the importance each culture places on different aspects of software. For
          instance, an empirical study by Evers and Day <span class="cite">[<a

          Chinese subjects, were more attracted towards usability than certain other qualities (It must be
          acknowledged that such studies represent a generalisation, since, in this case, there is much diversity
          <span 
class="ptmri7t-">within </span>the Chinese and Indonesian cultures. The study nevertheless supports the argument that
          perceived importance of software attributes is culture-dependent.). Since you cannot maximise
          every quality, this kind of information will tell you which areas to focus on for a given culture.
          Empirical studies can obviously not be conducted for each culture, but there are certain cues which
          will enable a rough guess. To understand the importance a culture places on different software

     features:
         <ul class="itemize1">
         <li class="itemize">Consult stakeholders from each culture.
         </li>
         <li class="itemize">Consider whether certain products have succeeded in their target markets due to a particular
         feature which their competitors lacked.
         </li>
         <li class="itemize">Determine if change requests from a particular culture exhibit recurring themes.</li></ul>

<span

href="#XLuong95a">22</a>]</span> discuss the
     English-language ability of the quality assurance engineers they deal with in Japan. Another
     culture-dependent process is user testing; some cultures appear to be more reluctant than others to criticise a

<span 
class="ptmb7t-">Rationale:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">Consistent culture models provide a central point for culture-specific details and also help developers
     compare and contrast cultures. If a developer notices that all of the cultures for a particular program use
     Latin characters, then the internationalisation phase need not consider the possibility of non-Latin
     character sets. Localisation will also be more efficient if similarities between cultures can be
     exploited.

<span 
class="ptmb7t-">Examples:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">There are several well-known culture models in anthropological and marketing literature. In
     &#8220;Understanding Cultural Differences&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHall90a">15</a>]</span>, Hall and Hall explain several culture-dependent variables, e.g.
     the level of detail people desire when presented with information, attitudes to personal space, whether or not
     people like to perform tasks in parallel.
     <!--l. 220--><p class="noindent">Luong et al. <span class="cite">[<a

class="ptmb7t-">as</span>
     <span 
class="ptmb7t-">a vector with a value for each dimension (or &#8220;factor&#8221;)</span>. A culture model is then a description with each
     dimension defined for that culture, e.g. if you decide the dimensions are language, timezone, and date
     format, then <span 
class="ptmri7t-">every </span>culture model in the repository will have those dimensions defined (definitions can be left
     blank if it&#8217;s obvious or not yet known).
     <!--l. 278--><p class="noindent">There are many potential sources for culture models. These include literature reviews, comments from local
     branches or consultants, results from requirements elicitation and user interviews, and observations of the
     system in action.
     <!--l. 283--><p class="noindent">If desired, divide the dimensions into categories. For instance, Mahemoff and Johnston <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMahemoff98b">23</a>]</span>,
     following a suggestion by Yeo <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XYeo95a">36</a>]</span>, discuss two broad categories &#8212; overt and covert factors. The
     former are obvious, tangible factors (e.g. date format), whereas the latter are ill-defined and
     potentially controversial. Overt factors can further be divided into several categories: time, language,
     writing, measures, formatting, and external systems (Table&nbsp;<span 
class="ptmb7t-">??</span>). Covert factors are composed
     of mental approach, perception, social rules, and usage context (Table&nbsp;<span 
class="ptmb7t-">??</span>). The overt factors
     could provide a valid starting point for your metamodel. The covert factors are more abstract
     and in need of refining before they are placed into a repository. For example, the Perception
     factor indicates icons should be chosen according to cultural understanding. Instead of including
     a broad &#8220;Perception&#8221; factor, it would be worthwhile storing a field for each major icon type
     you are likely to need. For instance, a &#8220;Mailbox Appearance&#8221; field if your software provides
     email. With all of these factors, you will need to filter them according to your organisation&#8217;s
     needs.

<span 
class="ptmb7t-">Rationale:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">The simplicity of this approach makes it accessible to people working in various roles. The metamodel

class="pcrr7tn-">Name-Value Pairs </span>pattern <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XRogers97a">29</a>]</span>.
     A culture vector can be viewed as a data structure, with dimensions and cultural information
     forming key-value pairs. In some instances, this could be mapped directly into a class or a
     database table. At the very least, it shows that the classification scheme is well-understood by
     developers.

     <!--l. 323--><p class="noindent">If cultures are classified according to the same dimensions, then it is also easy to see where they are alike and
     where they vary.
     <!--l. 326--><p class="noindent">Is it overly simplistic to characterise a culture as merely a set of key-value pairs? This depends on how the
     model is used. While the approach does not lead to a highly cohesive view of a culture, it is certainly a
     practical way to enable people to use and update a model. Also, Hoft <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHoft96a">17</a>]</span> discusses a number of
     metamodels, all resembling this pattern; each lists several factors by which cultures vary. They mainly vary
     in the ways they classify the factors, and the amount of attention paid to interaction among the
     factors.
     <!--l. 335--><p class="noindent">To avoid oversimplification, the value for each field can be a discussion of options, e.g. for
     units of distance in America, imperial units are used in some contexts and metric units in other
     contexts.

     on how closely they relate to the user-interface. The factors include character sets, numeric
     formats, and currency formats (non-UI), as well as icons, colour, and screen text (UI). These
     factors could form an embryo for a metamodel by which to document a culture model. Hoft <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHoft96a">17</a>]</span>
     discusses several well-known attempts to characterise a culture. Generally, these models are
     based on a number of dimensions, e.g. collectivism versus individualism, attitudes towards
     time.

     Another Japanese example is the suggestion that Japanese users prefer planning ahead instead of

     imports in US dollars.

<span

class="description"><span 
class="ptmb7t-">Group related preferences, so that only one choice needs to be made by the user to set all of</span>
          <span 
class="ptmb7t-">the preferences in the group to logically-related values. </span>The typical example is a message
          group: the user sets the messages to &#8220;French&#8221;, and all of the individual messages are set to
          &#8220;French&#8221;.
          <!--l. 1202--><p class="noindent">In some respects, this is like <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">Cultural Profile</span>, which also maps one choice to a number of predefined
          preference values. However, this pattern relates to subsets of the preferences rather than the overall
          preference vector. Furthermore, the direct nature of the group is often culture-neutral. For instance, a setting
          of &#8220;I like Warm Colours&#8221; might lead to orange buttons, red menus, and yellow backgrounds.
          This is a choice relating to the user&#8217;s favourite colour scheme rather than the user&#8217;s culture. Of
          course, there is still an indirect relationship because certain cultures like certain colours. For this
          reason, it is useful for the <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">Cultural Profile</span>&nbsp;to contain pre-set <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">Preference Groups</span>. In this
          example, there will be a &#8220;ColourScheme&#8221; preference group object relating to warm colours,
          i.e. a ColourScheme object with the following settings: &#8220;Button=orange&#8221;, &#8220;Menu=red&#8221;, and
          &#8220;Background=yellow&#8221;. An alternative ColourScheme object might be a cool colour scheme. We can then
          decide on a default ColourScheme for each culture. For instance, we might reference the warm
          ColourScheme object as the ColourScheme in the Australian <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">Cultural Profile</span>. If we later decide
          Americans also like the warm colour scheme, we can refer to the same object in the American
          <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">Cultural Profile</span>. This is preferable to manually defining the colours for each widget type for
          two reasons: (a) there is less effort, since the colour scheme has already been defined; (b) the
          &#8220;ColourScheme&#8221; <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">Preference Group</span>&nbsp;contains semantic knowledge (i.e. American interfaces default
          to warm colours) which would not be conveyed if only the individual widget colours were
          defined.
          <!--l. 1228--><p class="noindent">Sometimes the user can reach inside the group and set individual variables. This might make sense in
          the colour example, e.g. the user might prefer a different button colour. This is still possible.
          Other times, the user would be unlikely to change variables inside a <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">Preference Group</span>. If the
          <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">Preference Group</span>&nbsp;represents translated text messages, the user would likely have no desire to tailor
          these.
          </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb7t-">Examples:</span>  </dt><dd 
class="description">Any application enabling the user to specify natural language exemplifies this pattern. The GNU locale
          environment, for example, lets the user set a LC_MESSAGES variable which causes a number of strings to
          be translated in a particular language.

     <!--l. 1240--><p class="noindent">The example application, Critique, in Chapter&nbsp;<span 
class="ptmb7t-">??</span> contains an &#8220;Evaluation Style&#8221; preference. This determines
     how a score is calculated and what data the user sees; the user only sees data which affects the score. There
     are two views and two score algorithms, leading to four possible combinations. However, a design decision
     was made to couple these preferences via the group mechanism, so that only two of the four combinations
     are possible.

          locale-specific vector is used as a <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">Cultural Profile</span>&nbsp;to simplify the user&#8217;s task of setting preferences.
          According to <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">Cultural Profile</span>, the user should be given the option of choosing a culture. This is

     implemented by setting the &#8220;current&#8221; <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">Preference Dictionary</span>&nbsp;to the particular <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">Preference</span>
     <span

     revert to the global <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">Preference Dictionary</span>&nbsp;object.
     <!--l. 1506--><p class="noindent">The software will then be as specific as it needs to be. If some cultures do not care about background colour,
     simply leave it unspecified in their <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">Preference Dictionary</span>. The default background colour will be
     chosen, and a single change to that parameter will then propagate all cultures for which background colour
     needs no tailoring. For some parameters, it is fine if no culture-specific preferences are provided; these are
     culture-neutral preferences.
     <!--l. 1514--><p class="noindent">As mentioned in <span 
class="pcrr7tn-">Online Repository </span>cultures in the repository can be related to each other in a recursive
     manner. If desired, you can extend this concept to a hierarchical view of cultures, in which you progressively
     become more detailed. For instance, a French-Canadian user could use whatever French-Canadian
     preferences in the first instance, followed progressively by Canadian, then North American, then
     global. An alternative way to view this situation is to consider the algorithm for determining
     French-Canadian preferences: Begin by setting current preferences to global preferenceBundle.
     This preferenceBundle should define settings for each variable. Then, for all of the variables
     which are specified in the North American preferenceBundle, set the current preferences to
     these variables. Do the same for the Canadian preferenceBundle, then the French-Canadian
     preferenceBundle. The current preferences will therefore end up as specific to French-Candadian culture as
     possible.
