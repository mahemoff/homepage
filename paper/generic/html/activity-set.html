    This paper addresses the concept of generic tasks--low-level tasks which
    recur across different systems (e.g. remove, compare).  We propose that
    generic tasks can facilitate rapid brainstorming of functionality
    during early system design, and also indicate that they could provide a
    common vocabulary for concepts at a higher level of abstraction than UI
    objects. A taxonomy of generic tasks was prepared from fourteen
    software projects; a pilot study was conducted to investigate how
    people use the generic tasks. In this study, six subjects were
    presented with two hypothetical systems, and initially used a standard
    structured technique to propose as many new tasks as possible for each.
    Subsequently, they were introduced to the generic task list.  The
    results indicate that using the list helped subjects to generate new
    tasks which they had not previously proposed.

This paper addresses the concept of generic tasks--low-level tasks
    which recur across different systems (e.g. remove, compare). To
    demonstrate the existence of generic tasks, a taxonomy
    of generic tasks was prepared after analysing fourteen software
    projects. To illustrate one application of this approach, an empirical
    study was then conducted. Six subjects used a standard structured
    technique to to propose as many new tasks as possible for two
    hypothetical systems. They were then introduced to the generic tasks,
    and the results indicated that the generic tasks helped them add many
    new tasks to their existing list. In addition to the brainstorming
    technique we have demonstrated, generic tasks could support design
    reuse, act as a common vocabulary among designers, facilitate
    interdisciplinary design, and assist novel design.

Generic Tasks, Design Reuse, Task Analysis,
  Human-Computer Interaction

<P>
Introduction
<A NAME="sec:_introduction"></A>
<P>
An important component of design is the ability to imagine new
    possibilities for the system under consideration. If potential features
    are not sufficiently explored early on, the likely consequence is a
    system with unsatisfied users. Because system features are decided upon
    so early in the software lifecycle, failing to identify appropriate
    features leads to a costly redesign process.

<P>
One promising way to help designers generate novel ideas is to improve
    opportunities to reuse tasks which have been implemented in earlier
    applications. Designers can gain from reasoning by analogy to similar
    systems, as opposed to deriving a design purely from first principles.
    Brooks [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Brooks91a">4</A>] noted that it is unusual for engineering
    science to rely only on basic science to formulate new ideas. Pure
    scientific theory can provide <I>too much</I> detail, making it
    difficult for practitioners to draw analogies between their current
    situation and their past experiences.

<P>
Tasks which are typically performed by users can be placed into a
    taxonomy of ``generic tasks'', and designers of a new system can draw
    ideas from this taxonomy.  In a survey of user interface development
    processes and methodologies, Hartson and Boehm-Davis [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Hartson93a">7</A>]
    suggested the need for task taxonomies in HCI. According to the
    authors, taxonomies would help us to reuse task analyses.
    Taxonomies of HCI-related concepts such as tasks and user
    classes would also be valuable to designers.  Reuse of detailed software
    design has also become very popular, evidenced by widespread interest
    in software design patterns and frameworks (e.g.
    [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Beck96a">2</A>,<A
 HREF="node1.html#Kovitz98a">8</A>]).  This heightens the need to reuse artefacts
    related to software design and code, such as task models; there are
    synergies to be gained if we can map between recurrent task models and
    recurrent software design constructs.

<P>
The concept of generic tasks also provides a structured way to generate
    novel ideas. It is based on the assumption that there is a small set of
    generic tasks which can form the basis for many systems. For example,
    many systems are equipped with a ``Compare'' task (e.g. comparing two
    graphs, comparing two word-processor documents). Involved in a vigorous
    design process, designers (and users) may not even consider the possibility
    of allowing this functionality in their work. Once the system has been
    implemented, including the ``Compare'' task would probably require a
    substantial re-engineering effort. A couple of hours browsing through a
    list of generic tasks including the ``Compare'' task would reduce the
    likelihood of such events.

<P>
Of course, practitioners need to guard against ``feature creep'', i.e.
    using a list of generic tasks to derive obscure ideas and then
    implementing them without appropriate consideration of their
    usefulness. Indeed, the central aim of the generic task approach as a
    brainstorming technique is not feature generation for its own sake, but
    rather risk prevention; it helps to ensure designers do not overlook
    critical features. The proposal here is that generic tasks be
    incorporated into an integrative process of the developer's choosing,
    which would include a selection of regular HCI techniques (user and
    domain analysis, participatory design, evaluation, etc.).  A sensible
    application of generic tasks would take into account the capability of
    generic tasks to help explore avenues which might otherwise have
    been overlooked, and to do so at a very early stage.  Brooks argues
    that in HCI, the problem and the solution are both in need of
    consideration.  That is, we need to analyse the tasks users perform and
    the resultant systems which satisfy those tasks. This is analogous to a
    doctor describing a disease and its cure.  

<P>
In this paper, we describe how we obtained a list of twenty-two generic
    tasks from the requirements for fourteen industry-based, year-long,
    student projects. This process served to demonstrate that certain tasks
    do recur across different systems, and also laid the foundations for
    our pilot study. The predominately qualitative study was conducted to
    understand how people apply generic tasks and how they feel about the
    design technique. It should be noted that brainstorming is not the only
    application for generic tasks: the concept could also be used to form a
    common vocabulary. This would support interdisciplinary design and may
    also aid techniques for design reuse.

<P>
Identifying generic tasks

<P>
Some researchers have attempted to classify low-level tasks, e.g. Foley
    et al.'s [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Foley90a">5</A>] concept of ``basic interaction tasks'' for
    interactive graphics. For programs modelling two-dimensional space,
    they proposed four basic tasks: specifying a position, selecting an
    element, interacting with text, and specifying a numeric value.  The
    taxonomy also describes three ``composite interaction tasks'': dialogue
    boxes, construction techniques (e.g. specifying a line), and dynamic
    manipulation (adjusting previously-constructed objects, e.g.  rotating
    an object).

<P>
More recently, Baber [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Baber97a">1</A>] described several ``generic
    actions'' of human-computer interaction (HCI), on the basis of
    ISO/DP&nbsp;7942. The purpose was to establish a framework for discussing
    how various input devices compare in supporting particular tasks. Under
    this scheme, four categories were identified (with a total of seven
    actions): selecting objects, dragging objects, changing the orientation
    of objects (e.g.  rotation), and entering data.

<P>
There are also higher-level approaches to reuse, e.g.
    Breedvelt-Schouten et al. have demonstrated that segments of task
    hierarchies can be reused [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Breedvelt97a">3</A>]. This work attempts to
    formalise the notion of recurring task hierarchies, e.g. ``Define
    Query'' consists of a number of ``Enter Query parameters'' followed
    by ``Submit''.

<P>
Our work extends these contributions by capturing a broad list of
    generic tasks. We have also performed the analysis in a systematic
    manner which could be repeated, for instance, by an organisation
    wishing to capture recurring tasks among its own projects. Fourteen
    software projects were analysed. The projects were performed by teams
    of about four people, as a full-year third or fourth-year
    software project, and each was in the order of 10,000 lines of code.
    Clients were drawn from both industry and academia.

<P>
We narrowed down fifty candidate projects to the final fourteen
    according to two criteria:
    <DL>
<DT><STRONG>Human-computer interaction</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The system had to interact
             directly with humans.
        
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Complete documentation</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Complete software requirement
             specifications and user documentation were necessary.
             Requirements specifications had to contain usage scenarios.
             (Incidentally, all but one team provided design and
             testing documents, which could be used for later research).
    
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
There were no criteria relating to the the final product. In
    fact, the final product's usability was not considered because we were
    focusing on the <I>tasks</I> which emerged after
    requirements-gathering, rather than the ways in which the software
    supported these tasks. 

<P>
Key tasks were extracted from the usage scenarios. This enabled us to
    quickly identify a large number of tasks from a variety of domains.
    However, there was a concern about the depth of this approach; it is
    conceivable that particular families of tasks are systematically left
    out of these scenarios. Furthermore, scenarios are only single 
    episodes and can be difficult to generalise from--for example, to
    reason about common task sequences.

<P>
To address these concerns, seven diverse projects were selected for
    detailed task analysis (Table&nbsp;<A HREF="activity-set.html#table:_projects">1</A>), although key
    tasks from the other seven were also retained. There were three
    principles in selecting the projects to undergo task analyses: (a) we
    required a diverse cross-section of projects; (b) relatively complex
    requirements were favoured; (c) successful projects were preferred.
    User documentation and requirements specifications were consulted to
    extract task models for the systems.  The Jackson System Design (JSD)
    notation, adopted in the MUSE methodology for task analysis
    [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Lim94a">9</A>], was used to document the models. JSD was appropriate in
    this situation primarily because it is graphical and has a well-defined
    syntax. In combination, these attributes facilitate the process of
    analysing typical patterns.

After recording tasks for each project and placing them into
    categories, we obtained a classification reflected in Table&nbsp;<A HREF="#table:_____taxonomy"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="file:/usr/share/latex2html/icons/crossref.png"></A>. Although exploring these relationships is beyond the scope
    of this study, it is worthwhile acknowledging a few ways the tasks can
    be related to each other. One possible relationship is for a task to be
    a special case of another task. Another relationship is where two tasks
    complement each other.  Search and Navigate could be
    used in tandem by a user trying to locate a passage of text, for example.
    Sometimes two tasks are necessarily connected to each other, but can be
    performed in either order, e.g. when the system allows either ``noun-verb''
    or ``verb-noun'' actions.

<P>
The tasks were placed into five groups. Note that the term
    <TT>material</TT> is used to describe software artefacts, after Riehle
    and Z&#252;llighoven [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Riehle95a">11</A>]. The groups are:

<P>
OZ compress?
    <DL>
<DT><STRONG>Change Material</STRONG></DT>
<DD>These tasks enable the user to add, remove,
             or change the material.
        
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Handle Entire Material</STRONG></DT>
<DD>These tasks do not change a material,
             but operate on it as a whole. For instance, saving a file is
             an operation on a material which does not actually change its
             contents or structure.
        
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Browse Material</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Browsing helps a user explore a material,
            and might be used for viewing only, or to facilitate the
            changing of material. Examples are searching and navigating.
        
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Specify Material</STRONG></DT>
<DD>To help users change material, as well as
            perform other tasks, these tasks 
            let them specify information to the computer, such as choosing
            from a list of items.
        
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Meta-tasks</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Meta-tasks exist purely to moderate or expose the
             effects of other tasks. In isolation, they would not be very
             useful, but they can make tremendous contributions to overall
             usability when other tasks are possible. For instance, there
             are often functions which allow users to change the way
             certain tasks work, enabling a flexible workflow.  This is
             somewhat analogous to Sutchman and Trigg's concept of a
             procedural utterance in collaborative research--an element of
             speech which focuses on the collaboration process itself
             rather than the task at hand

<P>
The second column of the table shows examples of the tasks extracted
    from the selected projects. The third column demonstrates the external
    validity of these tasks by showing how each is supported by
    a typical word-processor, MS-Word in this case. The list presents a
    wide range of tasks, but no attempt has been made to produce an
    exhaustive collection of recurring tasks. The purpose is to show that
    generic tasks can be systematically captured, and to investigate how
    such a list might be used.

<P>
The tasks are a reflection of real-life projects, rather than an
    idealised set of activities. It might be argued that since the system
    should always be up-to-date, there should be no need for an ``Update
    System State'' task. In reality, however, systems may not have the
    processing power or bandwidth to continually synchronise with the
    user-interface. 
    

<P>
Pilot study of generic task applicability

<P>
Aims

<P>
One possible use of the generic tasks is to provide rapid
        generation of ideas for new software functions. We wanted to
        investigate whether such a brainstorming technique was possible.
        Furthermore, the generalisability of tasks could be demonstrated by
        taking generic tasks from one set of systems, and applying them to
        other systems.

<P>
Method

<P>
The methodology was to provide subjects with a standard structured
        method for devising new tasks, and then investigate whether
        introducing the generic task list could help them think of
        additional tasks. Six subjects volunteered to participate in the
        pilot study. Four were postgraduate students in the Department of
        Computer Science and Software Engineering Uni of Melb, and two
        were final-year undergraduate students in that department. All
        students had extensive programming experience. The subjects sat in
        individual sessions lasting 1.5-2 hours.

<P>
Two hypothetical systems were initially shown to subjects. One was
        ShopCart, a client-side application for internet shopping
        (independent of a web browser), and the other was Ready Reader, a
        hand-held reading device (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="activity-set.html#fig:_bothapps">1</A>). Several
        sketches of screens were provided for each, along with accompanying
        descriptions of possible tasks at each stage. Written instructions
        informed the subjects about the techniques they were being asked to
        employ.

<P>
In the first phase, subjects could use any means to produce the
        tasks. To make this stage comparable to the second phase involving
        generic tasks, a structured method was offered; however, it was
        made clear that this was only a brainstorming tool, and any other
        ideas were encouraged.  The structured method involved
        asking subjects to write down users' goals in using the system, and
        then to identify the problems users might have in achieving these
        goals. From these goals and problems, subjects were asked to write
        additional tasks which users might be able to perform with the
        system. Subjects were given guidance on the structured technique,
        as well as a worked example, and were informed that it did not
        matter if they got the concepts confused (e.g. defined something as
        a task instead of as a goal) because the administrator would
        interpret their work later on. Our aim here was to encourage
        subjects to provide as much information as possible before being
        introduced to generic tasks.

<P>
When subjects felt they had exhausted their ideas for each system,
        they entered the second phase. The generic task list was introduced
        to them as an alternative method, from which more tasks could be
        added to their initial list.  Subjects were asked to use the
        generic task list in a similar manner to the first approach, i.e.
        as a flexible brainstorming tool, so that they could feel free to
        suggest tasks which may not correspond directly to the generic
        tasks. To provide some structure, subjects were asked to step
        through each task, recording ideas for the system as they
        proceeded. Then, they were asked to write any other tasks they
        could think of. Finally, they were asked to step through the list
        and check if anything could be added. The experiment concluded with
        a semi-structured de-briefing discussion to clarify subjects' work
        and help us compare the approaches.

<P>
Results and discussion

<P>
Subjects' work was initially processed, with any identified goals
        or problems being converted to tasks if that was more appropriate.
        Tasks were eliminated if they seemed more like goals or problems,
        and counted once only if the person repeated them (it was quite
        common for people to rewrite a Phase 1 task as a generic task).

<P>
Many tasks proposed before the generic task list was introduced
        nevertheless mapped to a particular task (e.g. many people
        suggested a search function in the initial phase). Conversely,
        some tasks proposed after the list was introduced did not map to
        any particular generic task. Thus, we classified tasks according to
        (a) which phase they were identified in, and (b) whether or not they
        fitted a generic task.

<P>
Examples of new tasks

<P>
Before describing more detailed analyses, we now describe the
            tasks which were proposed more frequently, in both Phase 1
            and 2.  Following is a list of ShopCart tasks proposed by three
            or more people during Phase 1, accompanied by the matching
            generic task (the figures in parentheses indicate how many
            subjects listed each task).

It is also important to consider specific useful tasks which
            arose from the generic task concept.  Some examples of tasks
            which were <I>only</I> suggested during Phase 2 of the
            ShopCart application are shown below. It is interesting to note
            that most of these tasks are supported by existing e-commerce
            sites, but the generic task list seemed to trigger subjects to
            consider them.

<P>

            <BR>

Useful or novel tasks proposed only in Phase 2 for Ready Reader
            were:

<UL>
<LI>Change document orientation (Change Display Options)
</LI>
<LI>Show space used or free (Summarise)
</LI>
<LI>Show language of document or change language (Change
                      Display Options)
</LI>
<LI>Merge documents (Compose)
</LI>
<LI>Summarise bookmarks (Summarise, after the subject
                      suggested allowing bookmarks). 
            
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
That subjects considered these possibilities only after being
            exposed to the generic tasks lends support to the notion that
            brainstorming can improve quality and reduce the likelihood of
            tasks being overlooked.

<P>
Overall, both phases yielded results in favour of the generic
            task intervention, as shown in Table&nbsp;<A HREF="activity-set.html#table:_individuals">3</A>.
            Mean and standard deviation were calculated, although there is
            no statistical test performed. It is clear, however, that the
            generic task list had a marked effect. All subjects were able
            to think of several tasks before being shown the generic task
            list, and introducing the list led them to add several more.
            This result was true for both hypothetical systems.

<P>
One interesting result is the wide individual variation which
            occurred for both phases. This is not entirely surprising,
            since people will have different abilities in solving this type
            of problem. Some people seem to gain a lot of support using the
            generic tasks (Subjects B and D), while others appear to derive
            less benefit (Subject A). All subjects experienced relative
            increases in usage of generic tasks during the second exercise,
            Ready Reader. De-briefing discussions suggested that this was
            due to a learning effect in which the unusual concept of
            generic tasks becomes more familiar.

<P>
Number of unique tasks generated

<P>
The previous table considered individual performances, so that
            a task was counted twice if two people suggested it. In this
            section, we consider the tasks generated by the group as a
            whole.  In other words, we are looking at the number of
            unique tasks generated.

<P>
Table&nbsp;<A HREF="activity-set.html#table:_unique">4</A> shows that in both applications,
            introducing the generic tasks more than doubled the number of
            unique tasks suggested. This is despite the fact that
            individuals added fewer tasks on average in Phase 2 than they
            initially proposed in Phase 1 (Table&nbsp;<A HREF="activity-set.html#table:_individuals">3</A>).
            This demonstrates that generic tasks led to more variation
            among individuals; they led to many tasks which only one
            individual thought of. In contrast, there was more commonality
            among the initial tasks. People commonly proposed typical tasks
            such as Search for a book and Show cart total.

<P>
The table also shows that quite a few Phase 1 tasks mapped to a
            generic task. This makes sense, as designers presumably have
            their own models of generic tasks, some of which corresponds to
            those considered in this investigation. In de-briefing
            conversations, subjects indicated that in the first phase they were
            often considering software they had seen before. Several people
            commented that they had features of Amazon.com in mind when
            designing ShopCart.

<P>
Many tasks were suggested in Phase 2 only. A concern about this
            methodology is that subjects may not consider items important
            enough to record in the first phase, but will record them in
            the second phase if they see a corresponding generic task. This
            may have happened in a couple of instances. For instance, a
            Help function was not recorded initially, but on seeing the
            generic task ``Obtain Guidance'', three subjects proposed it.
            However, this was not the case for most tasks. Two useful Ready
            Reader tasks suggested by three people in Phase 2 but
            overlooked by everyone during Phase 1 were (a) grouping
            documents together for deleting or moving (``Compose'') and (b)
            changing font (``Change Display Options'').  Furthermore, the
            ``Both Phases'' column suggests that at least for some tasks,
            there can be high assurance that the generic list was helpful.
            This column shows that there were some tasks which some users
            thought of initially, and others thought of later on.

<P>
De-briefing discussion

<P>
Most subjects reported that they had some difficulties using the
            first technique to map from goals to problems to tasks. They 
            had difficulties understanding the distinction between goals
            and tasks, and also found there was a very close mapping
            between problems and tasks (Problem: ``Does not have Search'',
            Task: ``Let user Search''). However, we asked subjects to show
            mappings between goals, problems, and tasks.  This let us check
            how close the mappings were. It turned out that subjects were
            not overly-constrained by this technique, since they chose to
            add many tasks which did not correspond to particular goals or
            problems.

<P>
All subjects stated that they found it relatively easy to map
            from generic tasks to specific tasks in the system. Subject
            F--who did not perform many mappings-- stated that he did not
            have problems doing this, but felt that he had proposed the
            major tasks already.

<P>
One surprise for us was that several subjects perceived the two
            phases as a cohesive methodology. We had intended the first
            phase as an initial benchmark for the generic tasks, and we
            structured our instructions to give the impression that two
            separate techniques were being investigated (we did not
            identify whether any technique was our own). In fact, one
            Subject (Subject D) suggested that the goals helped to consider
            tasks based on users' perspectives, and the generic tasks act
            as a safeguard to ensure that any other useful tasks had not
            been omitted.  Another (Subject F) confirmed this view, stating
            that if she had started with generic tasks she may not have
            covered everything.  Therefore, she explained, it was good to
            start by considering users' goals, then moving on to tasks.

Conclusions

<P>
In the first half of this paper, we explained how studying tasks across
    a wide range of systems led us to a generic task list. This process
    demonstrated that certain tasks do recur across different programs and
    that generic tasks can be systematically documented. The initial
    classification we have provided may prove of some use to developers, as
    well as the method for capturing generic tasks.

<P>
In the second half, we described a pilot study which demonstrated that
    generic tasks can have practical implications for designers. A repeated
    measures methodology was adopted, in which the generic task list was
    introduced once subjects felt their ideas had been exhausted. Since
    there was no control group, it is not possible to be certain that the
    subjects would not have arrived at the new tasks without the generic
    tasks being provided. However, there is significant evidence to suggest
    the generic tasks themselves had at least a significant influence on
    the ideas of subjects during the second phase.  Firstly, the second
    phase took place immediately after the first phase, rather than a day
    or even an hour later. Secondly, many of the tasks proposed during the
    second phase were related to the generic tasks, with subjects
    indicating the associations.  Thirdly, the de-briefing discussions
    indicated that subjects felt comfortable with the generic task concept
    and most felt they had been able to apply them directly to the design
    problem.

<P>
A useful property of this brainstorming technique is that it only needs
    one or two hours of work, even in an industrial setting (although
    several iterations may be required). Thus, we were able to conduct an
    experiment similar in duration to an industry setting. We did not have
    to use contrived, small-scale, systems as examples; the hypothetical
    ShopCart and Ready Reader applications have a similar degree of
    complexity to many real-life projects.

<P>
It would be useful to expand the technique into a more integrative
    process which takes into account users' goals and contexts.  The
    technique might also involve participative design, since it should be
    very easy for users to comprehend the generic task concept. Further
    research might form more quantitative findings related to factors such
    as individual differences and application type. 

<P>
The brainstorming technique can be used to design for systems which
    have no obvious direct analogy. Researchers have previously suggested
    the consideration of related systems, e.g. MUSE's extant system
    analysis [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Lim94a">9</A>], and the competitive analysis described in
    Nielson's Usability Engineering approach [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Nielson93a">10</A>]. Generic
    tasks provide developers with a knowledge base, leading to
    greater confidence that existing systems have been considered.

<P>
The notion of generic tasks may be most beneficial when applied to
    a particular organisation's projects or confined to a specific domain.
    Using a method similar to the one presented here, it would be possible
    to ``mine'' tasks typically supported by a certain class of software.
    Databases, for example, support tasks such as ``View record'', ``Filter
    records'', ``Search for data''. Such a tool might prevent late change
    requests for a developer working on small projects where large-scale
    usability studies are prohibitive; for example, someone developing a
    database for video library holdings or staff management.

<P>
This paper has focused on only one application of generic tasks, i.e.
    as a rapid brainstorming technique.  In fact, there is a broad spectrum
    of possible applications for generic tasks. Reusable HCI knowledge
    bases and design techniques, exemplified by the popular design
    patterns paradigm [<A
 HREF="node1.html#Griffiths99a">6</A>], can be informed by an
    understanding of the tasks users typically perform. The
    interdisciplinary HCI community can benefit from a common vocabulary;
    when a human factors specialist asks a software engineer to implement a
    ``Change Display Options'' task, the software engineer has a pool of
    knowledge to draw upon about how generic tasks may be implemented in
    different environments. In this way, generic tasks raise the level of
    abstraction from commonly-known GUI elements (``scrollbar'',
    ``button'') to user tasks. Researchers can also benefit, by being able
    to compare interaction styles according to baseline generic tasks.
