<H1><A NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000">Incorporating Usability into the Software Process</A></H1>

<P>

My interest in patterns began after studying software process issues and
their relationship to usability. There are several difficulties in
integrating human-computer interaction and software engineering:
<P>
<OL><LI> Usability is only one of many qualities to achieve. To make
          matters worse, it is often in tension with other qualities, such
          as portability, maintainability, and reliability.For example, a
          fancy toolkit might improve usability, but reduce portability.<LI> Usability is necessarily iterative, because (a) we are unable to
          accurately predict human reactions to systems and (b) the
          task-artefact cycle suggests that people will always suggest
          enhancements after working with an application for some time
          [Hartson and Boehm-Davis, 1993]. Software, on the other hand, tends to degrade
          with every new cycle, making it increasingly difficult to
          understand and modify.<LI> HCI experts and software engineers have different perspectives
          and knowledge bases. 
          Usability may be less familiar to software engineers than other
          qualities because practical concerns meant that issues like
          performance and complexity took historical precedence within the
          software engineering community.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
Patterns are an important step towards resolving each of these issues:
<P>
<OL><LI> Patterns are about resolving forces which are in tension.
          Patterns can help to highlight situations when developers must
          make a trade-off between usability and some other factor. In
          addition, higher-level patterns which do not consider detailed
          software design can still help with decisions concerning
          sub-attributes of usability.<LI> Alexander's original vision for patterns was that they should
          support iterative development, and this vision has been carried
          forth into the software design pattern realm. Usability patterns
          can help to make incremental development a smooth process. This
          means less work for developers and a sense of consistency for
          users.<LI> Patterns are an excellent way to educate software engineers.
          Usability principles and guidelines also have this goal, but have
          been less than satisfactory [Mahemoff and Johnston, 1998]. Principles like
          ``Prevent user errors'' are not very useful in solving specific
          problems, whereas the generative nature of patterns means they
          can be applied more directly. Furthermore, patterns also
          facilitate communication by providing a common vocabulary. They
          are also a useful medium for communicating an overall design
          philosophy.
<P>
</OL><H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">Current Work in Usability Patterns</A></H1>
<P>
    In the past few years, many people have helped to bring the promises of
    usability patterns closer to reality. This section describes some of
    the work I have been performing as part of my PhD, in conjunction with
    my supervisor Lorraine Johnston.
<P>
    <H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000">Domain-Specific Usability Patterns</A></H2>
<P>
    Most usability pattern collections to date have been
    broadly-applicable, which can help provide patterns which are
    well-proven (because there are many examples to choose from) and aid
    practitioners, because they can reuse patterns in different situations.
    However, there is also a need to study usability patterns in more
    constrained contexts. The main advantage is that several patterns
    should fit together in a more cohesive manner if they are drawn from
    systems where the patterns are often applied in tight combination with
    each another. Thus, it is easier to produce collections of patterns
    which are more like the Alexandrian notion of a <i>language</i>, as
    opposed to a bunch of patterns.
<P>
    In our work, two forms of constraint have been considered. Firstly, we
    have looked at constraining the patterns according to a particular user
    characteristic, namely cultural background. Thus, we have developed a
    high-level pattern language to help developers produce
    internationalised software. The language has definitive entry points
    and a clear path towards the final product. A central pattern,
    Online Repository is shown in the appendix.
<P>
    A second constraint is domain. To this end, we have been considering
    usability of safety-critical systems, in conjunction with Andrew Hussey
    from the Software Verification Research Centre at the University of
    Queensland. An example is the Conjunction pattern, which
    suggests critical tasks should be performed more than once. This leads
    to another task organisation pattern, Transaction, which lets
    users specify a sequence of tasks before any of them are executed. A
    strong sense of connectedness arises from the fact that well-designed
    safety-critical systems usually contain similar features, and these
    features are combined in similar ways.
<P>
    <H2><A NAME="SECTION00022000000000000000">From Functionality and User-Interface Design to 
                Detailed Software Design</A></H2>
<P>
    I mentioned earlier that patterns can help to resolve the tension
    between usability and other software factors. In working towards this
    goal, I have considered how we can produce patterns of detailed
    software design which facilitate usability. In fact, many software
    design patterns already do this to some extent. The Command
    Processor [Buschmann et al., 1996] pattern supports undo, which certainly
    improves usability, and it is still sympathetic to other design issues.
<P>
    However, software design patterns which do support usability generally
    do so when the feature is well-established, such as <i>Undo</i>. As
    usability patterns emerge, there will be more opportunity to
    investigate how user-centered concepts can be effectively
    implemented in software.  The constrained-context pattern languages
    mentioned above are a useful starting point for producing these kinds
    of patterns. We have also looked at activities which recur across
    different applications, with a view to capturing ways in which software
    designers can support those activities.

This pattern is part of the high-level Planet pattern language for
providing software to users from diverse cultural backgrounds.

<P>

<DL > <STRONG> Context: </STRONG>You have begun to maintain Culture Models according
             to the same  (i.e. same factors for
             each culture).
<P><STRONG> Problem: </STRONG>
    As you start accumulating Culture Models, you will realise the
             need to organise them together.
            <STRONG>How can a collection of culture models be
                    organised in a manner which is useful for software
                    projects?</STRONG>
<P><STRONG> Forces: </STRONG>
        <UL><LI> Culture Models should be organisation-wide to avoid
                  duplication; it is feasible and desirable to
                  transfer information learnt from one project into other
                  projects.<LI> Information about cultures should be shared, but is often
                  discovered in physically-distant locations.<LI> If developers can't access the models quickly and easily,
                  the information will be ignored.<LI> If developers can't update the models easily, the
                  repository will lose accuracy over time.<LI> Cultures have relationships with one another. We should
                  be able to capture associations, such as one group being
                  a sub-culture of another group.<LI> It is useful to look up a specific Culture Model, but
                  there are many other ways people might like to access
                  information during the culturalisation process.
                  Depending on the task at hand, developers may wish to
                  explore the information in unanticipated  ways, e.g.
                  comparing two cultures, considering a single factor
                  across numerous cultures.
        </UL>
<P><STRONG> Solution: </STRONG>

    <STRONG>Create an online repository, accessible to the
        entire organisation. Compose it of Culture Models all based on the
        same .</STRONG>
<P>
        The following guidelines make it easy to <i>access</i>
        information in the repository:
        <UL><LI> Provide browsing facilities which present each culture and 
                  factor. Let the user select a factor (and show how each
                  culture varies on it), a culture (and show all of its
                  factors), or a combination of both.<LI> Provide facilities to search the Culture Models.<LI> Link from one model to another if it helps to demonstrate
                  a point of similarity or difference.<LI> Link to the original artefacts if they are online, or
                  identify the source if they are not.
        </UL>
<P>
        The following guidelines make it easy to <i>update</i> the repository:
        <UL><LI> Facilitate discussion among contributors, e.g. via
                  a mailing list or within the repository system.<LI> For each Culture Model, make one or more people
                  responsible for maintaining it.
        </UL>
<P>
        Large repositories can group Culture Models together, e.g.
        according to continent. This approach can follow the
        Composite pattern [Gamma et al., 1995], e.g. a model of Europe
        contains its own information and also contains child models
        (France, Italy, etc.). When a user looks up a model, information
        about its ancestor models are also shown.
<P><STRONG> Rationale: </STRONG>
    Like pattern languages, repositories of this nature help
        people reuse existing, tested, knowledge. Reuse of proven concepts
        involving human-computer interaction are particularly helpful,
        because people's reactions can be difficult to predict. In the case
        of interaction with international systems, the case for reuse is
        even stronger, because more work is required to obtain original
        knowledge (e.g. travelling overseas, establishing partnerships with
        foreign consultants).
<P><STRONG> Examples: </STRONG>
    Fernandes [Fernandes, 1995] contains some tables
        showing factors versus culture. However, the text stops short of
        exhaustively listing this information. One table might show
        cultures A, B, and C, and a table on other factors might show A, D,
        and E.
<P>
        Ito and Nakakoji [Ito and Nakakoji, 1996] discussed a knowledge base for software
        development organised according to culture.

<P>
        The authors are currently undertaking a project to build a
        web-based repository. The intention is that developers and users
        from around the world will use and contribute to the database.
<P><STRONG> Resulting Context: </STRONG>
    The repository enables developers to easily access a
        corpus of culture-specific information. You can use this
        information to specify Flexible Functions, an Elastic User-Interface, and
        Targeted Elements. Incorporate all culture-specific variants of
        each feature with .
