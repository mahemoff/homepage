<H1>"Design Reuse in Human-Computer Interaction and Software Engineering":
Thesis Abstract</H1>

    <span class="note"> This is the abstract for Michael Mahemoff's PhD.<A
    Href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au">The University of Melbourne</A>, completed
    2001. Supervisors: Lorraine
    Johnston  and Philip Dart.</span>

    <P>Practitioners of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) have a wide range of
    techniques and methodologies at their disposal, but few avenues for reusing
    successful design solutions. <span class="keyText">A mature discipline of
    HCI requires a systematic approach to learning from past results.</span>
    This thesis proposes a number of techniques for improving design reuse in
    HCI.  Some apply specifically to high-level design while others also
    consider detailed software design.

    <P><span class="keyText">The major focus is the adaptation of the pattern
    language concept</span> which originated in building architecture and town
    planning. It is argued that the properties of pattern languages suit many
    concerns for HCI. This motivates an investigation concerning how pattern
    languages for HCI might be documented and used.

    <P>This thesis is especially concerned with <span
    class="keyText">highly-constrained pattern languages</span>. Rather than
    producing a universal HCI pattern language, <span class="keyText">several
    languages are developed, each with a strong focus on a particular area. A
    tight scope, it is argued, provides a coherent language structure and
    therefore provides a strong degree of assistance to practitioners.</span>
    Three such languages are documented: (a) The Safety-Usability Patterns
    language focuses on safety-critical systems and demonstrates how <span
    class="keyText">a pattern language can provide guidance for high-level
    design</span>; (b) Multiple Model-View-Controller (MMVC) focuses on
    implementing a small set of tasks within the model-view-controller
    architecture, demonstrating how <span class="keyText">a pattern language
    can provide guidance on detailed software design and still address
    usability</span>; (c) Planet focuses on internationalised systems and
    combines the previous approaches to mix high-level design guidance with
    detailed design guidance, demonstrating the <span
    class="keyText">interdisciplinary capability of pattern languages</span>.
    Several <span class="keyText">other forms of reuse</span> are also
    considered: (a) online repositories, which store knowledge about user
    characteristics; (b) generic tasks, which capture activities recurring
    across many applications; (c) reusable software components, which can be
    documented via design patterns.

    <P><span class="keyText">Results of this work have been validated in
    several ways</span>.  An <span class="keyText">experiment with designers
    using generic tasks</span> indicated that they are useful for rapid
    brainstorming of software functionality.  A second <span
    class="keyText">experiment with designers using Safety-Usability
    patterns</span> led to a set of guidelines for developers and pattern
    authors. The Online Repository concept has been demonstrated with a <span
    class="keyText">prototype website</span> developed in conjunction with this
    project. <span class="keyText">Three programs have also been
    developed</span> which exemplify most of the MMVC and Planet patterns.  The
    results of this work are largely favourable for the techniques which have
    been proposed.  They indicate that <span class="keyText">pattern languages
    can facilitate reuse of high-level design, detailed software design, and a
    style of interdisciplinary design that bridges the various levels of
    abstraction which HCI must address</span>.
