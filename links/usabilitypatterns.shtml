<P> These are some of my favourite web resources about patterns and pattern
languages for Usability/HCI. Each reference here has been a great source of
inspiration for my own work. They are all concerned with the idea that a
pattern does not occur in isolation: they demonstrate the power of a cohesive pattern <I>language</I>.

<P> A more complete exhaustive reference is Tom Erickson's <A Href=

        Todd was an excellent shepherd for our PLOP 1999 submission :-). He
        has a very thorough understanding of the often-overlooked
        <em>language</em> aspect of patterns.

    <H2> Patterns constrained to particular domains, user types, non-functional

    An important aspect of my thesis is the argument that constraining 
    patterns to a certain area helps to generate tighter pattern languages.
    I'll add our work later on.

        [PDF - Jed Harris and Austin Henderson] <BR>
        A futuristic paper about pliant systems. Pliant systems researchers
        claim that human factors should be considered for systems at a deeper
        level, to fundamentally redesign computer architectures. Patterns? 
        Part of the vision is the application of patterns as a common language
        among multiple human and computer agents.<BR>
