<H1> Patterns of Town Planning and Building</H1>

  Where do patterns come from? Actually, many disciplines have used patterns in
  one form or another. Formally speaking, though, the roots of software design
  patterns can be traced back to Christopher Alexander's work on town planning
  and buildings.

         et al.'s Pattern Language</A> A handy summary covering all

         Alexander: An Introduction for Object-Oriented Designers</A>
